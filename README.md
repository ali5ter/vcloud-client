vcloud-client
=============

Very simple web client used to exercise the VMware vCloud Javascript SDK.

------------

This installs directly into your vCD dev cell (for now). To install run:

    install

The install script can also watch any changes you make to the files under 
the www/ (document root) directory and install the them into the vCD dev
cell automatically. Just run the following in a seperate terminal session:

    install -w
